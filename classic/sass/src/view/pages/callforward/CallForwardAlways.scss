/* mixins */
// @robert you can define a mixin here and use it anywhere.
// Good practise though, in case you want to share a mixin between widgets/modules,
// is to place it in the .scss of the common parent component - ultimately Main.scss.
// Variables of ext-panel-ui are listed here
// http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.2.0/classic/Ext.panel.Panel.html#css_mixin-extjs-panel-ui
@include extjs-panel-ui(
    $ui:'callforward-mixin-example' /*,
    $ui-body-color : red*/
);
/* custom css*/
// @robert move the rules which belongs to CallForwardAlways.scss and its children component
// from CallForward.scss to here
